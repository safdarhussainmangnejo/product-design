## Layout Approach

The Product Card uses a card-based layout with a flexbox or grid container to organize the product image, name, price, variant options, and action button. The design features padding, subtle shadows, and rounded corners to create a clean and modern appearance that follows UI/UX best practices.

## Responsiveness Considerations

The card is designed to be fully responsive. Its width adapts to different screen sizes using flexible units (percentages or max-width). Media queries adjust font sizes, image scaling, and layout direction, ensuring the card remains user-friendly and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
